# What information do we collect #

Par does not collect any information at all from you aside from one exception,
Inside the "profile fun" tab, if you turn on the (default off) check box to send your location data to a site, it will do this for the purpose of providing a custom web page based upon it.

# How do we protect your information? #
By simply destroying it immediately after it is no longer needed.

As far as this web site, accounts are controlled by google, you can see its privacy policy here. http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html (although this has nothing to do with par, only if you choose to make an account here to add a issue or something)
