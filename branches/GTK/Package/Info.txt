[Please note, some dlls have been packed into PubComb to make the gui not so crazy, functionality is the same]
--PubComb.dll
   Plugin Container system to put other plugins into the same gui.
   Do not load any plugin that PubComb already has, else you get duplicates.
   Currently Includes [ClientDetection.dll,IMLocator.dll,Lyra.dll,Handicap.dll,Penny.dll,DisableCaps.dll,LeetSpeak.dll,Cinderella.dll,ProfileFun.dll. GetHigh.dll, SpamProtection.dll, SitAntwhere.dll,FileProtection.dll, RadarChat.dll, ProTextion.dll, AwesomeSauce.dll,Coin.dll, SelectionBeams.dll, Retreat.dll]
--Coin.dll
    [Included in PubComb, no need to load]
    Made by day oh as a fancy type of penny (he made penny to, lul).  Click the gui window to change modes. heads = normal mode.  tails = replace texture with "day oh" identified texture. Lost picture = texture identification to rotate (some people will see your title change)
--SelectionBeeam.dll
    [Included in PubComb, no need to load]
    This replaces the beamparticles and merges it in with day oh (origiotor of the multi color particles ) 's selection beam mods.  It has a nice gui to let you pick whih effect you want.  buttons are prety self explantitory.  If you are using it under "SL Particle mode" here are the instrcutionns. (SL particle mode lets you change the texture of te beam.    to use , waer this object. ?? Wear it on your hand. And have thee plugins loaded.  To modify, simply delete the texture inside the contents of this item, and replace with w/e you want.  or if you are a scripter, everything is full perm
--RadarChat.dll
    [Included in PubComb, no need to load]
    Adds api support to MEGA boost your radar to be the best in SL!!.  No probes, no lag, instant response and updates. Your radar will need to be able to support the chat messages it sends with the keys of everyone in the sim.  Scans and updated 2Billion meters instantly.  Here is the api.  Client will send messages with all av keys, [sessionIdentifier (always incrementing)][number of keys this session][uuid1][uuid2]...[uuidN-1][uuidN] ;seperated by a delimiter of your choice. It might be multiple messages if the first one needs to be too long. It will send these chats every time the avartars in the sim changes (someone leaves or enters) and also forced if you llTriggerSound("76c78607-93f9-f55a-5238-e19b1a181389",1);
If you would like help making  your radar support this extra information, here is an example script, ???? and even a full radar that I made open source!    (just attach, amke your plugin speak on -90, and press the rainbow button).  Any improvements are welcome if you are a lsl scripter with some extra time!??,  Also, Hen Streeter has already made his multi gadget support this! So if you want the fastest multi tool in sl, get it here ??.  And if you sell your own, gime a lm and I will add it to the notecard.

    does not work unless you disable UpdateScriptTask, and UpdateScriptAgent capabilities with DisableCaps.dll (put them into the dropped side, and tp or relog).  It wil allow you to replace the text of scripts with anything you want, yet still have them run correctly.  Prompted from an old security vulnerability that has seince been fixed. Just add "(COMPILE_PROTECTED)" at the top of your script, and the rest is automatic. Your script wil be saved to your hard drive, and the server script will contain the top three lines of it only (maybe put copywright comments there).  This way the most they can steal are your comments.

Q. I get a "Faild to Initialize" message when I try to click the exe
A. This is because you don't have a recent version on the dotNet framework. Go Here  to get it :) http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=10cc340b-f857-4a14-83f5-25634c3bf043&displaylang=en

Q. I get an error when i get the start bbutton, and my program looks like this before hand. ??
A. You have loaded up the dlls from the wrong folder.  Remove them all, and then carefully make sure you only load plugins inside the folder named "Plugins"

Q. I can't log in when i use the -loginuri part.
A. You probably have an extra space, or you didnt spell something coorrectly, here, you can copy this part
"C:\Program Files\SecondLife\SecondLife.exe" -multiple -loginuri http://localhost:8080/

A. This happens if the irc plugin is having a hard time connecting (like if rein turned off her server -.-). just wait a few minutes and you should be ok, or change the server you connect to.

Q. I get an error concerning the plugin openjpqg-dotnet
A. You are trying to load PLugins From the wrong folder.  Make sure that you extracted correctly. there should be two folders, one called "ShadowFiles" another called "plugins" .  Make sure you load ONLY the ones from the plugins folder.
